The about code inserts some elements in to a stack. 
The while loop checks if the  is empty or not.
 The elements inserted be 4 3 2 1 .
The dequeue operations removes first inserted elements and push into a stack.
1 will be removed and pushed into stack.
Similarly the stack will be in form of   
4
3
2
1
So second while loop removes elements from stack and enqueues into a queue.
So 4 will be removed first.
The final elements in the queue will be 1 2 3 4
