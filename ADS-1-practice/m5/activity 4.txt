a.  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
In the queue, the elements which are inserted first are deleted first.
The elements from 1 to 9 are inserted as: First inserted element goes last
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
the elements removed will be 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. 
So possible
 
 
b. 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
Not possible
 
c. 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
Not possible


d. 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
